# Elephant_Hive_Knowledge_Graph
Elephant Hive Knowledge Graph


The client is seeking a software program in Python that can efficiently and effectively build knowledge graphs to visualize connections and relationships between different types of content. 
# Requirements:
•	Develop a software program(s) in Python to build knowledge graphs showing the connections and relationships between disparate content, such as web articles, PDFs, research papers and other text-based materials, in an efficient and effective manner. 
•	Ideally, if possible, the knowledge graphs could be created via an API so that it can be integrated easily with any app or local instances of Elephant Hive.
Objective:
The objective is to outline the necessary steps to set up the Flask application, establish communication with the OpenAI API, process user input, and generate a knowledge graph based on the provided URL, Text .

# Methodologies:

Set up Flask and OpenAI:
•	Import the necessary libraries: Flask and render_template from Flask, and openai.
•	Set the OpenAI API key.
Configure Flask:
•	Create a Flask application instance.
•	Enable the debugging mode.
Define routes:
•	Define the root route ('/') to render the index.html template.
Create the index route:
•	Implement the index route function.
•	Return the rendered index.html template.
Create the URL processing route:
•	Implement the route function for POST requests to the root route ('/').
•	Extract the URL from the submitted form data.
•	Send a request to the OpenAI API to generate a knowledge graph based on the URL.
•	Extract the graph from the API response.
•	Return the graph to be displayed on the web page.

# Run the Flask application:

•	Add the necessary conditional block to run the Flask application when executed directly.
Create the index.html template:
•	Define the HTML structure for the web page.
•	Include CSS styles to format the elements.
•	Add a form to submit the URL and API key.
•	Display the knowledge graph container.

# Create the JavaScript file (script.js):

•	JavaScript code for handling user interaction or dynamic updates.
# React file (react.js):

File for visulization
